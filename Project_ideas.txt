Main objective: Gain insights into the factors contributing to flight delays by examining correlations between key variables,
identifying patterns across airports and time, and ultimately predicting whether a flight will be delayed.
Through both statistical and machine learning approaches, the goal is to understand the relationship between delays, distances, airport operations,
and scheduling, which can help improve flight efficiency and inform decision-making for airlines and passengers.


1. Arrival and Departure Delay Correlation
Objective: Examine the relationship between departure delays and arrival delays to see if departure delays typically lead to longer arrival delays.

Steps:
Data Preparation:
Calculate departure delay: DepDelay = DepTime - CRSDepTime.
Calculate arrival delay: ArrDelay = ArrTime - CRSArrTime.
Analysis:
Calculate the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson correlation) between DepDelay and ArrDelay.
Visualization:
Use a scatter plot of DepDelay vs. ArrDelay.
Plot a trendline and include the correlation value on the plot.

2. Airport Delay Patterns
Objective: Identify which airports experience the most delays and find delay patterns across different airports.

Steps:
Data Preparation:
Group data by Origin or Dest to analyze delays per airport.
Calculate average delays for both departure and arrival delays.
Analysis:
Identify airports with the highest average delays (both departure and arrival).
Visualization:
Create a bar chart of airports ranked by delay times.
Optionally, plot airport delays on a map using longitude and latitude.

3. Delay and Distance Correlation
Objective: Investigate if longer flights are more likely to be delayed.

Steps:
Data Preparation:
Calculate delay as DepDelay and ArrDelay.
Use the Distance feature.
Analysis:
Calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson or Spearman) between Distance and DepDelay or ArrDelay.
Segment flights into different distance categories (e.g., short, medium, long-haul) for further analysis.
Visualization:
Use a scatter plot of Distance vs. Delay and add a trendline.

4. Delay Analysis by Day of the Week
Objective: Explore how delays vary based on the day of the week.

Steps:
Data Preparation:
Use the DayOfWeek column and calculate the average delay per day (departure and arrival).
Analysis:
Calculate average delays for each day of the week (1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday).
Visualization:
Create a bar plot showing average delays for each day of the week.
Optionally, visualize delays separately for departure and arrival.

5. Delay Impact on Flight Time
Objective: Analyze if delays have an impact on actual flight time (i.e., does a delayed departure lead to longer or shorter flight times).

Steps:
Data Preparation:
Calculate ActualElapsedTime - CRSElapsedTime to get the time difference between scheduled and actual flight durations.
Use DepDelay and ArrDelay to investigate the impact.
Analysis:
Investigate how departure delays affect flight time by calculating correlations or using regression analysis.
Visualization:
Scatter plot DepDelay vs. flight time difference and add a trendline.

6. ML Classification: Predicting Flight Delays
Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict if a flight will be delayed or not.

Steps:
Data Preparation:
Target: Binary classification target: FlightDelayed = 1 if DepDelay > 15, otherwise 0.
Features: Use relevant features such as CRSDepTime, CRSArrTime, Distance, Origin, Dest, DayOfWeek, etc.
Train/Test Split: Split data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20).
Modeling:
Model Selection: Use classification models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
Feature Engineering: Encode categorical features and consider adding interaction terms.
Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Visualization:
Plot feature importance and confusion matrix.
